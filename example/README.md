## About

This is an example program that extracts and graphs commit information from
repositories.

This directory contains a `Python 3.10` script that reads and extracts model
paths from an example JSON file (from the
[ONNX Model Zoo component](../ptm_torrent/onnxmodelzoo/README.md)).

This is then passed into
[`PRIME`](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PRIME) which extracts
commit related information and plots it.

## Dependencies

This program is dependent upon
[*PTMTorrent* being installed](../README.md#how-to-install), as well
[`PRIME`'s dependencies](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PRIME).

Python dependencies are managed with `pip` and
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

## How to Run

> Instructions were written for Linux operating systems

1. Change directories into the ONNX Model Zoo PTMTorrent directory:
   `cd data/onnxmodelzoo`
1. Create a `Python 3.10` virtual environment: `python3.10 -m venv env`
1. Activate virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
1. Upgrade `pip`: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
1. Execute the program with: `./run.bash`
